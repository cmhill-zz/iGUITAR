- Supply a better user guide

- Test and setup sample workflow for swt and web

- Create a common entry for all tools. It should do all common tasks such as log setup, cleanup ...Each tool should be a plugin running on the GUITAR platform 

- Write a common launching script for all tools 

- Write launching scripts for other platform (beyond Linux) - Or switch to a platform independent scripting language like python/ruby

- Get rid of args4j: Use the java cli library, which is  more popular and well support : http://commons.apache.org/cli/. This will also allow to pass any additional java parameter to the tool with out using the $GUITAR_OPTS environment variable. 

- Change gui2efg to use commons argument flags

- Get rid of jemmy (used to delay between events) so GUITAR can work as an independent tool (low priority) 

- Use maven build system instead of ant to better support module dependencies management

- Migrate the UNO plugin to the framework, to work with OpenOffice GUI

- Create a plugin for ICE so GUITAR can communicate with non-java GUIs

- Cleanup and redefine APIs for GUITAR
