This folder contains a typical GUITAR project. It is empty and used as a template for all projects.
It contains the following folders: 

src/
   The complete source code for this project.

install/
   The scripts used to install the project. 

testcases/
   Test cases that are run to make sure that the project is working. 

resources/
   Contains all "extra" files used by the project.  

Note that there is no doc/ folder here because we put all documentation
in the code. This is used by document generators (e.g., JavaDoc) to
obtain web-pages that serve as documentation.
