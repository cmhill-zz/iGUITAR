ANT TASK FOR DOXYGEN
====================

This project allows the invocation of Doxygen
(http://www.doxygen.org/) from within Ant (http://ant.apache.org/).

Doxygen is a different source-level documentation system, similar to,
but somewhat more detailed than JavaDoc.  Key examples are the use of
the following documentation tags:

JavaDoc			Doxygen
-------			-------
@author			@author
@version		@version
@since			@since
@param			@param
@return			@return
@throws			@throws
			@note
			@bug
			@todo
			@pre(condition)
			@post(condition)
			@invariant
			@par(agraph)

In addition to a richer documentation tag support, Doxygen can produce
many output deliverables: HTML (like JavaDoc), Compressed HTML, LaTex,
PDF, RTF, man, Postscript.

 Lastly, Doxygen leverages AT&T Research's GraphViz
(http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/) to generate various
graphs that become important when trying to understand the complexity
of a large set of sources.


LICENSING
=========

This software is licensed under the Apache Software License 1.1 terms
which can be found in the file named "LICENSE" in this directory.


FEATURES
========

* This Ant Task provides development teams with the ability to track
  environmental changes.  A minimum Doxygen version can be set with a
  hard or soft enforcement.

* The invocation of Doxygen is tuned to common Java build structures:
  * src/.../*.java
  * classes/.../*.class
  * doc/.../*.html
  The minimalist task tag is: <doxygen/>

* This Ant Task can optionally use a base Doxygen configuration file
  so that development teams working on multiple, similar projects can
  have a consistent documentation set generated.  Given a base
  configuration file, each build.xml file can augment the Doxygen
  configuration with just a few changes.

* This Ant Task now supports nested properties so that arbitrary
  Doxygen configuration properties can be embedded in your build.xml
  file if needed.


MINIMALIST USAGE
================

build.xml contains an example that is used by this project.
Additionally, there are other examples in examples/.

   <target name="documentation">
    <taskdef name="doxygen"
             classname="org.doxygen.tools.DoxygenTask"
             classpath="lib/doxygen_ant.jar" />
    <doxygen/>
   </target>
