1.6.0:
======
antlib.xml created as part of the URI . 

Now - doxygen tasks could be created by 

* Copying ant-doxygen.jar to $ANT_HOME/lib directory.

* Specify the URI in the projects as :

<project name="ant_doxygen"  xmlns:doxygen="antlib:org.doxygen.tools" ..  >

* Specify new task as 
  
  <doxygen:doxygen ...  >
  
  </doxygen:doxygen>
  
This should make way for a much better integration.
