OldRadioButton.EFG.xml is an EFG generated by the Ripper/EFGConverter tools in
an earlier revision, prior to (apparently) some major code changes resulting in
the EFG format being adjusted.  As a result, this EFG format is not incorrect,
and as a side-effect produces an ``unreachable code'' case in
SequenceLengthCoverage.  We exploit this to cover some portions of the code
that we otherwise can't get to.  This is somewhat unsatisfactory, but it is
unclear if any given GUI software can produce an EFG with this error normally,
so we must resort to this.
