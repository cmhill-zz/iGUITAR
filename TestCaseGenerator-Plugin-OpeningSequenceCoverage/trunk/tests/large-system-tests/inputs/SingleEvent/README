We create a simple EFG file here, SingleEvent.EFG.xml.  The EFG is simply a
single event that links back to itself.  This exploits one branch of
RandomTestCase, which checks for such a situation (supposedly).  Ideally a GUI
program could be created that does this, rather than relying upon us creating
an EFG directly.
