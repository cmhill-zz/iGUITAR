What's New in this release

    * The GUITAR.v1.1.zip archive comes with a very small GUI program (installed in the ./aut/ folder) that can be used as a "Hello World" example; all the execution scripts settings default to the example. The settings are handled via .properties files.
    * We have a README-USERS.txt file that explains how to run the Hello World program.
    * The TestCaseGenerator has a new plugin that does a random walk of the event-flow graph and outputs test cases.
